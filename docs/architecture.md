# Architecture and ownership

[Documentation index](README.md) · [Repository instructions](../AGENTS.md)

## Status

At the time this documentation was written, this checkout has no `package.json`, application source tree, or GitHub workflow files. The target architecture, scripts, and workflows in this guide must be created and verified during bootstrap.

The following architecture is the target recorded in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). Paths and integrations are design boundaries, not evidence that files or services already exist.

## Purpose and target structure

waypoint-api-gateway is the only API the applications and third-party integrations see (`api.<domain>` behind Traefik). It verifies session tokens and personal API tokens, sets the current organization, limits throughput, routes to the internal services and aggregates their responses (task detail, home, command palette). Local port 3000.

| Aggregate       | Composed from                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Task detail     | task-service (task) + integration-service (Git links) + storage-service (attachments) + notification-service (reminders) |
| Home            | task-service (my priorities, sprint) + notification-service (mentions, activity)                                         |
| Command palette | search-service                                                                                                           |

Public routes without a session: a list's intake form, newsletter, contact form, GitHub and GitLab webhooks. API token scopes: `tasks:read`, `tasks:write`, `members:read`, `webhooks:manage`.

## Architectural ownership

- `src/auth/`: token verification, scopes, organization context.
- `src/rate-limit/`: per-token counters in Redis.
- `src/routes/<resource>/`: one folder per public resource.
- `src/aggregates/`: compositions across services.
- `src/public/`: routes without a session.
- `src/clients/`: clients generated from the internal specs, one per service.

## Boundaries

- No database: Redis only, for rate-limit counters.
- No domain decision: a rule that decides something belongs to the owning service.
- Internal services are reached only through clients generated from `openapi/internal/`; never a hand-written URL.
- Webhooks from GitHub and GitLab are relayed unchanged to waypoint-integration-service, which verifies their signature.
- No sibling sources imported, no `file:` or `link:` dependency.

## Cross-repository changes

Each checkout owns its implementation and release. Use published `@waypoint/*` packages instead of sibling source imports or local dependency links. For contract changes, make the contract and generated package available first, then update the producing service, gateways and listeners, and finally the webapp. Each step should remain deployable independently.
