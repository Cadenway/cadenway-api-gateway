# waypoint-api-gateway

waypoint-api-gateway is the only API the applications and third-party integrations see (`api.<domain>` behind Traefik). It verifies session tokens and personal API tokens, sets the current organization, limits throughput, routes to the internal services and aggregates their responses (task detail, home, command palette). Local port 3000.

| Aggregate       | Composed from                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Task detail     | task-service (task) + integration-service (Git links) + storage-service (attachments) + notification-service (reminders) |
| Home            | task-service (my priorities, sprint) + notification-service (mentions, activity)                                         |
| Command palette | search-service                                                                                                           |

Public routes without a session: a list's intake form, newsletter, contact form, GitHub and GitLab webhooks. API token scopes: `tasks:read`, `tasks:write`, `members:read`, `webhooks:manage`.

## Getting started

Requirements: Node.js LTS and pnpm (versions in `package.json`), and Docker.

1. Clone this repository next to the other Waypoint repositories, flat, in one folder.
2. To run it with the rest of Waypoint, start the stack from `waypoint-ops`; it builds the sibling
   folders, this one included (`core` profile; `full` adds every other service):

   ```bash
   cd ../waypoint-ops/compose
   docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.local.yaml --profile core up -d
   ```

3. To work on this repository alone:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm start:dev              # http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Checks

Run the narrowest check first; CI runs them all on every pull request.

```bash
pnpm format:check
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test src/<area>
pnpm test:integration                    # Redis in Docker, internal services faked
pnpm test:coverage
pnpm build
docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml config -q
```
